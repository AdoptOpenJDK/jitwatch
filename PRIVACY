========================

This document describes the privacy implications of using JITWatch to analyse your program code or JIT log files.

============
Talking back
============

JITWatch does not transmit any information about your usage of the program, the log files you load, or any code 
you execute in the sandbox.

=====================
Downloading resources
=====================

The first time you double-click on a bytecode in the TriView screen JITWatch will attempt to download the 
JVM Specification from the https://docs.oracle.com website.

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-6.html
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/javaspec.css

These downloads are made over the HTTPS protocol and once successfully downloaded they will be stored in your 
jitwatch folder and will not be downloaded again.

=============
Build systems
=============

If you build JITWatch from source using maven or gradle then those build systems will download various further 
dependencies required to compile, package, test, and execute the build targets.

=======================
Sharing JITWatch output
=======================

JITWatch contains a screenshot feature. If you share screenshots from JITWatch, or snippets of your LogCompilation 
XML or disassembled compiled methods you may divulge information about your program.
