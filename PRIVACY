========================

This document describes the privacy implications of using JITWatch to analyse your program code or JIT log files.

============
Talking back
============

JITWatch does not transmit any information about your usage of the program, the log files you load, or any code 
you execute in the sandbox.

=====================
Downloading resources
=====================

The first time you double-click on a bytecode in the TriView screen JITWatch will attempt to download the 
JVM Specification from the https://docs.oracle.com website.

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-6.html
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/javaspec.css

These downloads are made over the HTTPS protocol and once successfully downloaded they will be stored in your 
jitwatch folder and will not be downloaded again.

JITWatch offers the option to download the hsdis HotSpot disassembly binary from https://chriswhocodes.com
This is an optional download. If you choose to download the binary your IP address will be logged in the webserver
logs which are retained for 14 days.

=============
Build systems
=============

If you build JITWatch from source using maven or gradle then those build systems will download various further 
dependencies required to compile, package, test, and execute the build targets.

=======================
Sharing JITWatch output
=======================

JITWatch contains a screenshot feature. If you share screenshots from JITWatch, or snippets of your LogCompilation 
XML or disassembled compiled methods you may divulge information about your program.
