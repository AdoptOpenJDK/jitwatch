Thanks for considering contributing to JITWatch!

Please make sure any changes compile with Java 7 as I have no plans to drop support for this Java version.

Before submitting a big PR or major refactoring please open an issue and let's discuss to make sure it's in line with the aims of this project.

Many thanks!
